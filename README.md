# BallAndBoardWebGL

Hey! This is my first published game. Please put on fullscreen mode when you start playing. 

Known issues: The game only works perfectly on 1920x1080 resolution so please use the fullscreen mode.
              Ball speed somestimes increases or decreases more than it should. This bug often happens when playing on the hardest difficulty.

Anyways, have fun! :)
