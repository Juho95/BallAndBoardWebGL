# BallAndBoardWebGL

Hey! This is my first published game. Please put on fullscreen mode when you start playing. 

Known issues: The game only works perfectly on 1920x1080 resolution so please use the fullscreen mode. This is just a test version. Works better on .exe 
              Ball speed somestimes increases or decreases more than it should. This bug often happens when playing on the hardest difficulty. Ball moves very slowly if difficulty               is on the lowest.
              
NOTE!!!! Before you start playing, go to options and increase the difficulty and audio volume.

Anyways, have fun! :)
